# Mern-Sample app

In the first version we just have simple view that shows us the list of emails and a form for adding new email and passwords to the list.



## These are list of Tasks that would be done in each commit (in below order):

- ~~Add update method to backend~~
- ~~change email address to a mask~~  
- ~~Selecting Items from list and update just password field~~
- ~~add some simple stiles to front~~
- ~~update feature for front~~
- ~~BUG: after update the item in the list don't updated.~~
- ~~Review and refactor frontend code~~
- ~~Review and refactor backend code~~
- ~~Create custom hook for calling APIs according to a specific config~~
- ~~Adding material ui and using its style and UI elements for app~~
- ~~Display Errors in Snackbars or toasts~~
- ~~After Select any item in list email text box will be focused for data entry~~
- ~~Review and refactor Front-end code.~~
- add gpg signing key for commits. (test1)

these items would change after any commit. new items would be added here and the done items would have a overline.
bear with me while I'm developing this app.
