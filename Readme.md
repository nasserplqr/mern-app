# Mern-Sample app

In the first version,
we just have a simple view that shows us the list of emails and a form for adding new email and passwords to the list.



## These are a list of Tasks that would be done in each commit (in below order):

- ~~Add update method to backend~~
- ~~change email address to a mask~~  
- ~~Selecting Items from list and update just password field~~
- ~~add some simple stiles to front~~
- ~~update feature for front~~
- ~~BUG: after update the item in the list don't updated.~~
- ~~Review and refactor frontend code~~
- ~~Review and refactor backend code~~
- ~~Create custom hook for calling APIs according to a specific config~~
- ~~Adding material ui and using its style and UI elements for app~~
- ~~Display Errors in Snackbars or toasts~~
- ~~After Select any item in list email text box will be focused for data entry~~
- ~~Review and refactor Front-end code.~~
- add gpg signing key for commits. (test4)

these items would change after any commit.
new items would be added here and the done items would have an overline.
bear with me while I'm developing this app.
